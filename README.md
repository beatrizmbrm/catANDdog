#  Deep Learning Image Classification Project

##  Overview
This project applies **deep learning** and **transfer learning** techniques for binary image classification. Built on **Google Colab**, the core model uses a pre-trained **VGG16** architecture, adapted for custom image categories.

##  Technologies
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

##  Dataset Structure
Images are organized into three sets:
